# Nokolisp_On_Nokia_phone

This replaces all operating systems (Geos, MSDOS) in Nokia 9110 communicator.

Nokolisp is running alone using direct BIOS-calls.

This was done in emergency in backcountry, because bloody MSDOS-file was corrupted.

Contains much strangeness, like adjusting processor clock intelligently.
