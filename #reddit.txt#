BTW. Interesting feature of this phone was it had adjustable clock
speed from 8 Mhz to 198 Mhz.  It offered interested dilemmas as you
had to choose at which speed you should execute a function.  You could
run (hyper-speed) only few seconds before the CPU started to smoke,
which was kind of dangerous. Error-trap started of course with
(slow-clock).
